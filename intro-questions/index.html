        <h1>Intro Questions :D </h1>

       <p><ol>
        <li>My name is Sydney Tran. I'm a junior double majoring in Psychology and Communication Design. </li>
        <li>I love all things design and primarily have been working in print media. 
            I joined this class because I am curious to learn about how 
            we can best use the digital landscape to reinvent story telling and increase 
            accessibility to trustworthy information! </li>
        <li>I have zero experience with coding.</li>
        <li>I hope to learn foundational skills in UX/UI design.</li>
        <li>When you print a poster or a book it is only possible for your audience to view your projects in one size.
            Digital design requires more thoughtfulness about the screen an audience may access your project with.</li>
        <li> 
            
            <a href="https://smiski.com">smiski</a>: As a Smiski collector, 
            the Smiski brand is iconic and their website effectively translated 
            their physical product into a website. It is recognizable through the consistent use of color and fonts. 
            The organization is intuitive and guides the viewer to get to know the brand in a playful way.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://gretelny.com/">gretelny</a>: Gretel's homepage immediately introduces the company in a brief effective way and lets
            their portfolio speak for itself. This is a great example of not needing to overload viewers to communicate an idea. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/">eyeondesign</a>: I personally love this website because it considers the different niches in design and encourages exploration in how design intersects with other topics. It is well organized and labelled allowing for a streamline user experience. Also, if you leave the browser on and go afk eye balls icons populate the screen!
