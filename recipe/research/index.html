    <h2>Recipe Website Inspo</h2>
    
    </p> <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/">NY Times Cooking</a>: I enjoy how the images speak for the website and the scale used to show off detail. I also appreciate how just because the information is hierarchially important doesn't mean it needs to be thick and wide! </p>

    </p> <a href="https://www.babi.sh/">Binging with Babish</a>: In general I enjoy how simply this layout is. I hate that it is paywalled. But the overall layout functions well for the website.</p>

    </p> <a href="https://www.monoware.com/blogs/journal/butter-beans-with-stracciatella-cheese-and-spiced-garlic-butter">Monoware</a>: Another simple but bold design. I enjoy that the landing section is simpler while more information is presented when scrolling down.</p>

    <h2>General Website Inspo</h2>

     </p> <a href="https://littlefatboy.com/">Little Fat Boy</a>: I just love big type big everything. It sets the tone and doesn't bombard the viewer with information... yet. </p>

    </p> <a href="https://www.plenty.ag/">Plenty</a>: Punchy bold colors with good contrast which is hard for yellow. Lowkey it does kind of hurt my eyes but I don't mind. 

    </p> <a href="https://andwalsh.com/">And Walsh</a>: Great use of horizontal space with no padding on the sides. Very clear system for design. </p>
