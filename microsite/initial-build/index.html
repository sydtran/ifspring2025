<p>Kelela, who openly identifies as queer, created a reading primer in 2020 for her friends, family, and business partners. It included resources like Reader on Misogynoir by Kandis Williams, The Will to Change by bell hooks, Algorithms of Oppression by Safiya Umoja Noble, and content from Sonya Renee Taylor and the Seeing White podcast. This primer inspired others to create similar resources during the George Floyd protests.</p>
